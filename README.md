The Classic Brick Breaker Game -Vaibhav Kapoor

Its the recreation of the classic arcade game Breakout in which features a bouncing ball that the player must use to smash a wall of bricks while preventing it from going out of bounds by using a paddle. The player gets 3 lives to start with and a life is lost if the ball hits the bottom of the screen. When all the bricks have been destroyed, the player advances to a new, harder level.

Arrow keys are the primary controls for the simulator. The controls are straight forwared with the Left and Right Arrow keys controling the paddle as the ball moves and deflects off blocks. To navigate the menu screen just use the mouse to click the options and you are ready to go!

# Current Beta

The game is mostly functional with a few minor bug fixes which are being worked on such as accuracy in block detection and deflection along with the overall smoothness of the paddle controls to make it easier for the player to control it. A possible implementation with mouse guidance to control the paddle is being explored.
